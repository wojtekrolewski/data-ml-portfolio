# Wojciech Rolewski - Portfolio

## About Me
I am a data-oriented engineer with a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
My experience spans statistical data analysis, time series, and machine learning, including an industrial computer vision project carried out during an apprenticeship. I enjoy working at the intersection of data, algorithms, and real-world problems, with a particular interest in analytical and technology-driven roles.

## Portfolio Structure
This portfolio is divided into two main areas:
- **Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics** – projects focused on modeling, algorithms, and image/data-driven decision systems
- **Data Analysis & Statistics** – projects emphasizing exploratory analysis, statistical inference, and interpretation of real-world data

Each project is presented as a self-contained case study with a clear problem statement, methodology, and key results.


## Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics

### Fiber Break Detection from SEM Images (Industrial Project)
**Focus:** Computer Vision, ML, applied analytics

**Description:**
Development and evaluation of image-based methods for detecting and classifying fiber break sources from SEM images. The project combines image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning to support industrial quality analysis.

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, ML models
